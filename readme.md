## About

This repository contains my solved LeetCode problems (C++ and Python). Each problem lives in its own folder named with the 4-digit problem id followed by an underscore and the problem title. The goal is an organized, easy-to-scan archive I can use for revision, interviews, and sharing examples.

<!-- ## Per-problem notes

For any problem folder you add, a short `README.md` inside the folder should include:

- A one-line summary of the problem (or link to LeetCode).
- Brief approach / key idea (2–6 lines).
- Time & space complexity (concise).
- Edge cases or gotchas (1–2 bullet points).
- Optional: sample input / output.

This makes scanning your repo far faster and helps future-you remember the idea without re-reading code.

---

## Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Add per-problem `README.md` for existing folders.
- [ ] Auto-generate the problem index table from folder names (script planned).
- [ ] Add topic tags (two-pointers, dp, greedy) to index for faster filtering.
- [ ] Add a small "top patterns" curated list (50 problems) for interview prep.
- [ ] Add changelog if repo grows beyond ~200 problems.

## Quick tips

- Keep each solution **single-purpose** — one problem per file.
- Always include **complexity** in the folder README — it's the first thing reviewers check.
- Use consistent naming: `0001_Two_Sum/solution.cpp`. Inconsistent names will make automation brittle.
- If you later add automation (index generator), keep folder metadata minimal and consistent (e.g., `difficulty:` in each problem README).-->
